The best way of learning is doing.

## Python

* [smally](https://github.com/xinlin-z/smally), compress JPG,PNG,GIF in batch and parallel mode (Python, Shell, SQLite)
* [autopass](https://github.com/xinlin-z/autopass), automatically enter password for sudo, ssh and scp command (Python)
* [portfly](https://github.com/xinlin-z/portfly), remote/local port forwarding by TCP/UDP tunnel (Python)

## PyTorch

* [Flood Image Classification](https://github.com/xinlin-z/STEM_Research_AUT), coursework, fine-tuning a pre-trained VGG16 model on a relatively small dataset to do binary classificaition
* [LSTM](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1NIHWiUFyN7Xcto3q0lKjud4wnolMKJ0R?usp=sharing), coursework, build a simple LSTM model to predict waterlevel
* [Transformer](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/109BNSj6rjewtiqJejC-4AED3ddm6OxIe?usp=sharing), personal learning, build a transformer model, tokenize price information, and adopt greedy decoding only to predict price trend of bitcoin
